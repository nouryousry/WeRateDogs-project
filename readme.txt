This project is part of Udacity nanodegree program. The data used was the tweet archive of the WeRateDogs twitter account. Some data was given and some was fetched using twitter API as well as file of dog breeds predictions based on images present in the tweets.
The aim of the project was to import this data, using python and its libraries, clean this data after needed assessment then analyzing the data, visualizing it and creating a meaningful report.
